# App.tsx Refactoring

## Overview
The `App.tsx` file was refactored from 369 lines to approximately 120 lines by extracting responsibilities into smaller, focused modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom Hooks Created

#### `hooks/useCrosswordState.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages all crossword state and localStorage persistence
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Grid state management
  - Active cell tracking
  - Direction state
  - History management (undo/redo)
  - localStorage persistence for state and history

#### `hooks/useCrosswordActions.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages all crossword actions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Undo/Redo functionality
  - Erase board
  - Create new puzzle
  - All action handlers

#### `hooks/useTheme.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages theme state and persistence
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Theme state (light/dark)
  - Theme toggle handler
  - DOM theme attribute management

#### `hooks/useClueManagement.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages clue updates and word processing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Clue update handling
  - Word processing utilities

### 2. Utility Functions

#### `utils/gridUtils.ts`
- **Purpose**: Pure utility functions for grid operations
- **Functions**:
  - `assignClueNumbers()`: Assigns clue numbers to grid cells
  - `computeWordIndices()`: Computes word boundaries
  - `getWordAt()`: Gets word at specific position
  - `createInitialGrid()`: Creates empty grid

### 3. Constants

#### `constants/crossword.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralizes all crossword-related constants
- **Constants**:
  - Grid sizes and dimensions
  - Direction constants
  - Keyboard mappings
  - UI dimensions

## Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each hook has a single, clear responsibility
- State management is separated from business logic
- UI logic is separated from data logic

### 2. **Reusability**
- Hooks can be reused in other components
- Utility functions are pure and testable
- Constants are centralized and maintainable

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Easier to test individual pieces

### 4. **Performance**
- Better memoization opportunities
- Reduced re-renders through focused state management
- Optimized dependency arrays

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Better TypeScript support with focused types
- Easier to find and fix bugs
- Clearer code organization

## File Structure After Refactoring

```

├── App.tsx (120 lines - focused on layout and composition)
├── hooks/

```

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to component interfaces
- localStorage persistence continues to work
- All event handlers maintain the same behavior
